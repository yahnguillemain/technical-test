# Technical TEst

The purpose of this project is to propose a set of Junit tests allowing to test skills of a candidate.

## How To

The master branch aims to contains the correction, in order to validate that unit tests are correctly written.

Then the technical-test branch is the code which will be provided to candidates as a starting point for the test.

So to add new test, write your code in the master branch. Then merge it to technical-test branch and remove all code that the candidate should write.

NB: You must not forgot to remove .git folder before providing the code to the candidate.
